            It's hard to explain what a spectacularly bad idea it is to bet in a lottery.
            You have a better chance of being struck by lightning—twice—than winning the
            Powerball lottery. But that doesn't stop people from trying.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our approach is to let people see the results of betting on the lottery,
            versus saving their disposable income.
            It all happens much more quickly than in real life,
            and you won't lose a cent.
        </p>

            Here's how the simulation works:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Each "day" has two phases. First you earn your disposable income ($2, by default).
                Then you bet, immediately getting the results. </li>
            <li> You can choose different <b>betting strategies</b> and even different <b>lotteries</b>.
                We only simulate one <em>real</em> lottery, at the moment, but even the mythical
                fair lottery is interesting. </li>
            <li> You can also choose the <b>length of time</b> to simulate and the <b>interest rate</b>
                for your invested money.</li>
            <li> <b>Everything is completely random.</b>
                It's perfectly possible for you to win the jackpot here,
                but it's just as unlikely to happen as it is in real life. </li>
        </ul>


        <h2> Tips </h2>

        <dl>
            <dt> Simulation running too slowly? </dt>
            <dd> Toggle <b>Go faster</b>. </dd>

            <dt> Simulation running too quickly? </dt>
            <dd> Click the pause button: <glyph icon="pause"></glyph><br>
                Then click the step button to advance one phase (half a day):
                <glyph icon="skip_next"></glyph> </dd>

            <dt> Want to start all over? </dt>
            <dd> Click the reset button: <glyph icon="replay"></glyph> </dd>

            Technology, data sources, why this demo exists...
        </p>

        <p> TO DO: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Add the real content we want to this tab. </li>
            <li> Add alt text to all the glyphs. </li>
            <li> Add some artwork, better styles (but not too many), ... </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div *ngSwitchDefault> Uh oh. You've found a bug. No content available for {{content}}. </div>
