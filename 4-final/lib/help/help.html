      It's hard to explain what a spectacularly bad idea it is to bet in a lottery.
      You have a better chance of being struck by lightning—twice—than winning the
      Powerball lottery. But that doesn't stop people from trying.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach is to let people see the results of betting on the lottery,
      versus saving their disposable income.
      It all happens much more quickly than in real life,
      and you won't lose a cent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's how the simulation works:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Each "day" has two phases. First you earn your disposable income ($2, by default).
        Then you bet, immediately getting the results. </li>
      <li> You can choose different <b>betting strategies</b> and even different <b>lotteries</b>.
        We only simulate one <em>real</em> lottery, at the moment, but even the mythical
        fair lottery is interesting. </li>
      <li> You can also choose the <b>length of time</b> to simulate and the <b>interest rate</b>
        for your invested money.</li>
      <li> <b>Everything is completely random.</b>
        It's perfectly possible for you to win the jackpot here,
        but it's just as unlikely to happen as it is in real life. </li>
    </ul>

      <li> How this app was coded </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> How the lottery results are calculated </h2>
    <p>
      This app uses simple probabilities from sources such as the
      <a href="http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_prizes.asp">Powerball site</a>
      to draw tickets. You can go much deeper using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_mathematics">lottery mathematics</a>.
    </p>
   
    <h2> How this app was coded </h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/filiph">Filip</a>
      wrote this app to accompany a code lab demonstrating
      how to use an early release of AngularDart Components.
